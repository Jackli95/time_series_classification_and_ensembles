# Time series classification using keras

This is a notebook that I made for a hands-on introduction to deep learning using keras.

The main focus of this notebook is to introduce different architectures and different layers in the problem of time series classification.

Some of the layers that we are going to use are Dense, 1D convolutional, LSTM, and other types of layers.

Finally we are also going to see some examples on how to ensemble different models.

We are going to classify the time series of the
[Human Activity Recognition Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones##) which

## Getting Started

[models](https://github.com/ivanlen/time_series_classification_and_ensembles/blob/master/models.py)

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
